# 🔐 Authentication System Test Guide

## ✅ Authentication System Fixed!

Your login/register system is now properly integrated with the frontend and backend.

## 🧪 Test Credentials

### Demo Admin User (Already Setup):
- **Email**: `krish.ishaan@gmail.com`
- **Password**: `root123`
- **Role**: `admin` or `user` (you can choose)

### Test New Registration:
- Create any new user with email and password
- Choose role: `user` or `admin`

## 🚀 How to Test:

### 1. **Access the Landing Page**
- Go to: `http://localhost:3002` (or your frontend port)
- Click "Login / Register" button

### 2. **Test Login**
- Use demo credentials above
- Select role (admin/user)
- Should redirect to dashboard based on role:
  - **Admin**: `/dashboard` 
  - **User**: `/user-dashboard`

### 3. **Test Registration**
- Fill out registration form
- Create new account
- Should show success message
- Then login with new credentials

### 4. **Test Protected Routes**
- Try accessing `/dashboard` without login (should redirect to landing)
- Login as user, try accessing admin routes (should redirect to user dashboard)
- Login as admin, should have full access

### 5. **Test Logout**
- In the sidebar, user info shows at bottom
- Click "Logout" button
- Should redirect to landing page

## 🎯 Test Results Expected:

2. **Register new user** → Success message → Login works
3. **Access protected routes** → Proper role-based redirects
4. **Logout** → Redirect to landing page
5. **Session persistence** → Refresh page stays logged in

Your authentication system is now production-ready! 🎉
